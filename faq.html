    they do, which is usually all DPS and Tanks<br><br>

    <b>Main application window</b><br><br>
    File -> New to make a new rotation for your current spec and class - name it logically, like 'RogueAssasin', 
    and not just 'Rogue'. Press "Ctrl" over icon generated by your <a href="http://41.185.28.111/guide.php">addon of choice</a> for rotation priority and 
    then "Setup" button, and "Add" once done. Setup logic is <b>similar to</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLeGDc49Occ">this setup guide</a> for chimpeon<br> 
    Once you have added all the spells you want to then click "Start" or "Alt + X". It is always a good idea to 
    press "Start" after adding your first spell so you can see that it works as expected<br><br>
